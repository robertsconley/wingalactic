This project uses vanilla Visual Basic 6 to replicate the QuickBASIC environment that Galactic v2.4 was designed to run under. The viewer functionality is pretty much complete. But the generators still need work. The general design flow of the project is to write a series of helper function so I can copy and paste from the original galactic source code. After I verify basic functionality, I reformat the code in a better style. Finally I start subsituting variable names for longer names to make it easier to follow the logic of the original code. 

HOW TO RUN
Since Windows 7, most windows come with the Visual Basic files needed to run the executable without any installation. It is design to drop into an existing Galactic folder and just work.

This is a problem with high resolution monitor. This is due to the use of the Terminal Font to faithfully replicate the look and feel of Galactic. Eventually the goal is to convert the User Interface into forms. In the source code there are experimental forms that I been playing with to explore the best way to do this.
